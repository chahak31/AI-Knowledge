How can a computer reason about facts and draw conclusions from the facts?

Using MODEL CHECKING

1. To determine if knowledge base entails some query alpha (KB |= alpha):

2. Enumerate all possible models //In other words, consider all possible values of true and false for our variables

3. If in every model, where our knowledge base is true, alpha is also true. Then KB entails alpha.

4. Otherwise, KB does not entail alpha
